## Important Notes

1. **UUIDs**: The sample data uses realistic UUID format. Supabase will auto-generate UUIDs if you omit the id column during import.

2. **Image URLs**: The slides CSV contains placeholder image paths. Make sure to:
   - Upload actual images to your `public/images/` directory
   - Update the image_url paths to match your actual files
   - Or use external image URLs

3. **File URLs**: The resolutions CSV contains example document URLs. Replace these with actual document links or remove the file_url column if not needed.

4. **Dates**: All dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format as required by PostgreSQL.

5. **Boolean Values**: Use `true`/`false` (lowercase) for boolean columns.
